We're a small hardware design company near Portland, Oregon. We help bring your project idea to life by creating the physical prototype you need for investors or crowdfunding. We can take you from an Arduino stack to a production-ready custom printed circuit board.

We work on both closed and open source projects of all kinds, from a 3G cellphone to the [Lego-compatible Crazy Circuits](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/browndoggadgets/crazy-circuits-unique-stem-projects-delivered-mont) educational kits. We're particularly interested in open projects which support environmental science.
