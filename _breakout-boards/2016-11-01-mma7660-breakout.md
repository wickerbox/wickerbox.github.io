Breadboard-compatible 3.3V 3-axis accelerometer. The I2C lines already have 1K pullup resistors, so you don't need any other components.

The [Github repository](https://github.com/wickerbox/Basic-Breakout-Boards/tree/master/mma7660-sensor-breakout) has the [manufacturing files](https://github.com/wickerbox/Basic-Breakout-Boards/blob/master/mma7660-sensor-breakout/mma7660-sensor-breakout-v1.1.zip?raw=true). The project is released as open hardware under the CERN v1.2 Open Hardware license.

I've [shared the project at OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/YDCCxiCM) so you can buy a set of three bare boards for $1.25, or $0.41 per board. The parts are available at [Digikey](http://digikey.com). 

If this is your first time building a board, check out our [assembly howto](/kicad-workflow/assembly/) and remember to always buy a few extra of the capacitors and resistors. They're very small, easy to lose, and often cost 30 cents for three but $1 for 100.
