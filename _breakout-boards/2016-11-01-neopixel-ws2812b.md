The WS2812B is a small-package surface mount RGB LED which must be used with 5V. This breadboard-compatible board breaks out the LED and includes a 470-ohm resistor on the input DI line to protect against voltage spikes. The project is released as open hardware under the CERN v1.2 Open Hardware license.

You can order a set of three bare boards for $1.20 <a href="https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/DExj7dKh">from OSH Park</a>.

The board was built up on Feb 7 and tested.
