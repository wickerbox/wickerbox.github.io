Breadboard-compatible SD connector breakout that can be used with a 5V or 3.3V microcontroller. The onboard TXB0104 converts the MOSI, MISO, SCLK, and CS signals to 3.3V for the card.

The [Github repository](https://github.com/wickerbox/Basic-Breakout-Boards/tree/master/sd-full-2041021-4-breakout) has the [manufacturing files](https://github.com/wickerbox/Basic-Breakout-Boards/blob/master/sd-full-2041021-4-breakout/gerbers/sd-full-2041021-4-breakout-v1.1-gerbers.zip?raw=true). The project is released as open hardware under the CERN v1.2 Open Hardware license.

I've <a href="https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/5Za8zt2A">shared the project at OSH Park</a> so you can buy a set of three bare boards for $10.15, or $3.38 per board.

The parts are available at [Digikey](http://digikey.com). If this is your first time building a board, check out our [assembly howto](/kicad-workflow/assembly/) and remember to always buy a few extra of the capacitors. They're very small, easy to lose, and often cost 30 cents for three but a dollar for 100.

This board will work with any standard micro SD card. We recommend testing the board with the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/SD">Arduino SD Library</a>. Recent Arduino IDE downloads come with SD sketches under the 'Examples' section of the menu. A sketch like CardInfo should work right away.
