Bills of material might look very different, depending on who you're sharing them with. I like to have a readable table in my documentation so I need a version of the BOM written in Github Markdown. 

```

It usually comes out like this in the PDF:

The netlist included a lot of fields on each component that I don't need, so I usually create a master .csv (comma-separated variable) file that can be imported into a spreadsheet program like Excel or OpenOffice. I usually just leave this one in the repository and don't include it in the deliverables zip file, since it's really hard to read.

From that master, I do create a minimal, readable version in .csv that has all the vendors on it. This isn't so overwhelming.

```

```

Finally, I create a set of vendor-specific files that can be uploaded directly to their websites. This can include something like what Digikey expects:

```
Ref,Qty,Description,Digikey PN
C2 C6,2,CAP CER 10UF 25V X7R 1210,587-2599-1-ND
C3 C4,2,CAP CER 22pF 100V C0G NP0 0603,399-11145-1-ND

F1,1,RESETTABLE FUSE 1.1A 25V MF-MSMF,MF-MSMF110/24X-2CT-ND
```

As well as something more stripped-down like Seeed:

```
Location,MPN/Seeed SKU,Quantity
C2 C6,TMK325B7106KN-TR,2
C3 C4,C0805C220J5GACTU,2
C7 C8 C9 C1 C5,GRM188R72A104KA35D,5
D1,SMAJ14A-13-F,1
D2 D3,SS12-E3/61T,2
F1,MF-MSMF110/24X-2,1
```

Every time I work with a new vendor, I can add a function in my Python script that pulls the columns I need out of the master list and formats them appropriately.

The most important thing about this process is that I did all my work on component selection and vendor selection back in the beginning, when I was drawing the schematic. I don't have to waste any time copying names, entering part numbers, or whatever. I can just take the vendor-specific files and upload them and check that all parts are in stock. 

If they are, then I can import my netlist to the PCBNew part of KiCad and get on with designing the printed circuit board.
