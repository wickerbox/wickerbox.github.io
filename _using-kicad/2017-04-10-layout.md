For those of us coming from Eagle, the very first thing you see when you open up PCBNew is a real "WTF?!" moment, because it's just a blank page with a fab drawing outline. That's OK, because the very first thing I do is go to `File > Page Settings` and fill in the worksheet information like I did the first time I opened EESchema.

Another note here is that I started out using the black background for routing and that's what I'm comfortable with, so all my templates use it automatically. I don't know if there's a way to change it but this is just How I Was Taught and it's fairly standard practice.

##### Importing the Netlist

Once I've updated the page settings, I'm ready to tell PCBNew what my schematic already knows: which footprints to use and which pads are connected. My schematic created this information when I added symbols and drew all the wires; the information itself is saved in the netlist, usually called `myprojectname.net`.

I tell PCBNew about the netlist by clicking on the `NET` icon:

<img src="/img/kicad/netlist.png">

PCBNew brings up the Netlist menu and I leave all the default options in place before clicking `Read Current Netlist` at the upper right. If everything went OK, the `Messages` window at the bottom will have no red writing. Everything will be green to indicate success or gray to indicate information.

When I click `Close`, I get another shock: KiCad likes to put all the footprints on top of each other at the center of the screen. First thing is to zoom out, then the second is to get these footprints separated. This is where the canvas options come in.

##### Default Canvas for Auto Placement

The canvas has to be in Default mode for the autoplacement to work, so the first thing is to hit `F9` or go to `View > Switch Canvas to Default`. This is what this canvas looks like, with all the parts on top of each other.

Next, I make sure Mode is selected.

Then, I can right-click anywhere in the layout area and select `Global Spread and Place`. Then, I've never had much luck with the option to `Automatically Place All Footprints` so I just click `Spread Out All Footprints`. 

PCBNew will ask me if I really want to move all the components that aren't explicitly locked in place, and I'll say `Yes`.

Finally, that's something I can work with! Now, the only other thing to really talk about before starting to route is the Visibles tab on the right-hand side of the screen.

##### Default Trace and Via Sizes

The cool thing about a template is it lets you set your DRC rules and standard track sizes. They're easy to switch between.

##### OpenGL Canvas for Interactive Routing

One of the coolest new features of the last two years has been the addition of interactive, dynamic routing. It only works on the OpenGL canvas, so the first thing is to hit `F11` or go to `View > Switch Canvas to OpenGL`. I prefer this canvas in general so I usually just use the Default canvas for the initial placement, and then I'll switch to OpenGL the rest of the time.

There's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCG4daPvuVI">good explanatory routing video made by the CERN folks</a> on YouTube.

##### PCBNew General Stuff

The lefthand menu shows things that have already been placed. The righthand menu has the action buttons to place things like traces, footprints, polygon fills, artwork, and text.

For routing in general, I do a lot of `x` and `escape` to start and stop the routing. 

Global spread and place might be useful, but my workflow is often to grab individual sets of components. I like `t` to get and move a particular component. 

<hr>

##### Updating and Changing Footprints 

Footprints can be updated easily by editing the library, editing the CvPCB association, regenerating the netlist in EESchema, and re-importing the netlist in PCBNew. Think of EESchema as the driver and PCBNew as the passenger; EEschema knows about the function of the circuit, while PCBNew just has to interpret the instructions by connecting footprint pads. 

<hr>

##### Board Outline (Edge Cuts)

At some point, I need to put down the outline. It's an annoying box since it's broken up into straight line pieces and it's not easily resized, so I don't usually worry about it until I've got the placement worked out and I'm ready to start routing properly.

I place the outline by selecting Edge.Cuts as the active layer, and using the graphics for circles, arcs, and lines from the righthand menu.

<img src="/img/kicad/outline.png">

OSH Park in particular processes board outlines a little differently from most fabricators, and wants to see a watertight board outline on the Edge.Cuts layer <em>by itself</em>, with no extra text or anything. Cutouts, slots, and notches are OK but any extra measurement text or fab notes are interpreted by the website upload system as part of the board outline to be milled. It's generally better to enable one of the assembly-related documentation layers and put those notes there instead.

##### Polygon Fills

This is the fill zone icon -->

What menu comes up depends on which layer is highlighted when the fill zone icon gets clicked.

And polygon fills leads right into the Design Rules Check because fills don't automatically update, so you can either get in the habit of hitting `b` (redraw fills) a lot, which is a good habit, but you also should definitely run DRC before generating any plots.

##### DRC

Have to deal with the DRC. Do it.
