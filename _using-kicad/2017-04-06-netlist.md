When the schematic is done and saved, the next step is to create the netlist. 

There are a number of ways to do this, but I usually just click on the `Netlist` button in the schematic editor. You can add plugins but I decided to just write a parser for the netlist itself and run that in Python.

I click `Netlist` and `Generate` and save the .net file locally.

That file is a readable text file that you'll want to use to import into the board layout part of KiCad (PCBNew) when the time comes. For now, let's look at it:

The first part of the file includes the project information.

```
(export (version D)
  (design
    (source /home/wicker/proj/Basic-Breakout-Boards/atmega328/atmega328.sch)
    (date "Sat 31 Dec 2016 02:50:41 PM PST")
    (tool "Eeschema 4.0.4+e1-6308~48~ubuntu16.04.1-stable")
    (sheet (number 1) (name /) (tstamps /)
      (title_block
        (title "Basic Atmega328 Breakout Board")
        (company "CERN Open Hardware License v1.2")
        (rev 1.2)
        (date "31 Dec 2016")
        (source atmega328.sch)
        (comment (number 1) (value jenner@wickerbox.net))
        (comment (number 2) (value http://wickerbox.net))
        (comment (number 3) (value "Wickerbox Electronics"))
        (comment (number 4) (value "")))))
```

Then, the list of individual components listed with their reference designators. Here are two of them from the beginning of the section:

```
  (components
    (comp (ref X1)
      (value "16MHz 18pF")
      (footprint Wickerlib:CRYSTAL-CTS-4SMD)
      (datasheet http://www.ctscorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/008-0260-0.pdf)
      (fields
        (field (name Package) CRYSTAL-CTS-4SMD)
        (field (name MF_Name) CTS)
        (field (name MF_PN) 406I35D16M00000)
        (field (name S1_Name) Digikey)
        (field (name S1_PN) CTX1206CT-ND)
        (field (name Description) "CRYSTAL 16MHz 18pF 40 OHM 4SMD")
        (field (name Verified) "Not Verified"))
      (libsource (lib wickerlib) (part CRYSTAL-16MHZ-18PF-40OHM-CTS-4SMD))
      (sheetpath (names /) (tstamps /))
      (tstamp 572E8F94))
    (comp (ref C2)
      (value "10uF 25V")
      (footprint Wickerlib:RLC-1210-SMD)
      (datasheet http://www.yuden.co.jp/productdata/catalog/en/mlcc_all_e.pdf)
      (fields
        (field (name Package) 1210)
        (field (name MF_Name) "Taiyo Yuden")
        (field (name MF_PN) TMK325B7106KN-TR)
        (field (name S1_Name) Digikey)
        (field (name S1_PN) 587-2599-1-ND)
        (field (name Description) "CAP CER 10UF 25V X7R 1210")
        (field (name Verified) "Not Verified"))
      (libsource (lib wickerlib) (part CAP-CER-10UF-25V-X7R-1210))
      (sheetpath (names /) (tstamps /))
      (tstamp 572E8FD2)))
```

Next is the list of definitions of each part. There may be several components (C1, C2, C3) for a symbol (CAP-CER-0.1UF-100V-X7R-0603). 

```

  (libparts
    (libpart (lib wickerlib) (part CAP-CER-0.1UF-100V-X7R-0603)
      (description "CAP CER 0.1UF 100V X7R 0603")
      (docs http://search.murata.co.jp/Ceramy/image/img/A01X/partnumbering_e_01.pdf)
      (fields
        (field (name Reference) C)
        (field (name Value) CAP-CER-0.1UF-100V-X7R-0603)
        (field (name Footprint) Wickerlib:RLC-0603-SMD)
        (field (name Datasheet) http://search.murata.co.jp/Ceramy/image/img/A01X/partnumbering_e_01.pdf)
        (field (name Description) "CAP CER 0.1UF 100V X7R 0603")
        (field (name MF_Name) Murata)
        (field (name MF_PN) GRM188R72A104KA35D)
        (field (name S1_Name) Digikey)
        (field (name S1_PN) 490-3285-1-ND))
      (pins
        (pin (num 1) (name ~) (type passive))
        (pin (num 2) (name ~) (type passive))))
    (libpart (lib wickerlib) (part CAP-CER-10UF-25V-X7R-1210)
      (description "CAP CER 10UF 25V X7R 1210")
      (fields
        (field (name Reference) C)
        (field (name Value) CAP-CER-10UF-25V-X7R-1210)
        (field (name Footprint) Wickerlib:RLC-1210-SMD)
        (field (name Datasheet) http://www.yuden.co.jp/productdata/catalog/en/mlcc_all_e.pdf)
        (field (name Description) "CAP CER 10UF 25V X7R 1210")
        (field (name MF_Name) "Taiyo Yuden")
        (field (name MF_PN) TMK325B7106KN-TR)
        (field (name S1_Name) Digikey)
        (field (name S1_PN) 587-2599-1-ND))
      (pins
        (pin (num 1) (name ~) (type passive))
        (pin (num 2) (name ~) (type passive))))
```

KiCad also includes where the find the libraries.

```
  (libraries
    (library (logical wickerlib)
      (uri /home/wicker/wickerlib/libraries/wickerlib.lib)))
```

And, finally, the actual netlist that PCBNew will use to draw the airwires between each connected pad in the board layout, as well as to use in the Design Rules Check to make sure you haven't connected signals that should be separated.

```
  (nets
    (net (code 1) (name +5V)
      (node (ref U2) (pin 4))
      (node (ref U2) (pin 6))
      (node (ref D3) (pin 1))
      (node (ref R1) (pin 1))
      (node (ref J4) (pin 1))
      (node (ref JP1) (pin 2))
      (node (ref J5) (pin 1))
      (node (ref U2) (pin 18))
      (node (ref C9) (pin 1))
      (node (ref C7) (pin 1))
      (node (ref C8) (pin 1))
      (node (ref J3) (pin 2))
      (node (ref J2) (pin 4)))
    (net (code 2) (name "Net-(D2-Pad1)")
      (node (ref F1) (pin 2))
      (node (ref D2) (pin 1)))
```

In the next section, I'll share my Python script to create a bill of materials.
