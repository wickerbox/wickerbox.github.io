Wickerbox is a hardware design company in Joseph, Oregon, specializing in developing the physical prototype you need for investors or crowdfunding. 

We can take you from a wire-stuffed breadboard to a production-ready custom printed circuit board.

We work on both closed and open source projects of all kinds, from a cellphone to the [Lego-compatible Crazy Circuits](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/browndoggadgets/crazy-circuits-unique-stem-projects-delivered-mont) educational kits. 

We're particularly interested in open projects which support environmental science.
