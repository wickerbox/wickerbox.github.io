These breadboard-compatible board breaks out 9V, 5V, and 3.3V from a 9V battery or any other input power source that works with the voltage regulator.

The board comes in a through-hole and a surface mount version. 

The KiCad schematic and layout, along with the bill of materials, are available at the <a href="https://github.com/wickerbox/Input-Power-Boards">Github repo</a>. The project is released as open hardware under the CERN v1.2 Open Hardware license.

## Through-Hole v1.1
