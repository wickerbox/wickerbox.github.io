This project is based on the Explorer E202, with permission. 

Renato Romero put plans online for a Very Low Frequency (VLF) receiver capable between "a few Hz to beyond 10 kHz [which] makes it suitable to to receive radio signals of natural origin; signals not generated by human activity but by physical phenomena such as lightning and solar storms. Received signals are heard directly in your headset. The receiver amplifies the electric component of an electromagnetic signal."

His plans are <a href="http://www.vlf.it/romero2/explorer-e202.html">described here</a>. The Explorer E202 is no longer available for sale.

He gave me permission to work from his schematic to design a new layout and make my own units. I am releasing all of my documents and process under the CERN Open Hardware License v1.2.

## Assembled v1.1 Receiver with Case

A fully assembled v1.1 in a box looked like this:

## Assembled v1.4 Receiver Board

The final board for v1.4, which is the release version, looks like this:

## Cost

Total cost of parts is about $25 if you order minimums. It's about $100 if you go to the next price break for most at qty=10, which is what I did since I'm prototyping, and what I recommend if you want to build two or more units. 

OSH Park: $35.35 for a set of three bare boards [<a href="https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/NvQSoarW">Shared Project #NvQSoarW</a>]

Digikey cart: $24.40 for parts for one board [<a href="http://www.digikey.com/short/32fqdm">Shared Cart #32fqdm</a>]

You can get the documentation PDF, an uploadable Digikey .csv file, and the board manufacturing files in <a href="https://github.com/wickerbox/E202VAR-Natural-Radio-Receiver/blob/master/e202var-vlf-radio-receiver-v1.4.zip?raw=true">this zip file</a>.
