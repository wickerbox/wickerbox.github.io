This is a simple protoboard DIP daughter board for when you need something more durable than a breadboard. The protoboard holes are connected where indicated by exposed copper, for easier wire routing and soldering.

The KiCad schematic and layout are available at the <a href="https://github.com/wickerbox/protoboard-dip-for-chip/">Github repo</a>. The project is released as open hardware under the CERN v1.2 Open Hardware license.

This project was created using the <a href="https://github.com/wickerbox/wickerlib/tree/master/templates/chip-dip-2layer">CHIP DIP KiCad template</a> from Wickerlib.

Buying bare boards from [OSH Park](sN7i0l9V) costs $17.50 for a set of three. You'll want to buy the headers separately.

For a non-stackable version, you can just use two standard 0.1" (2.54mm) pitch 1x40 headers, each snapped in half.

For a stackable version, you can use two of these extra-tall 2x20 female headers <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1979">from Adafruit</a>. The connectors are from the Samtec SSQ family so you could shop around for other distributors, but Adafruit has by far the best price for this particular component.
